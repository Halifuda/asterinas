# Subagent Dispatch Stub (Strict Funnel)

**Role ID:** REVIEWER
**Pass Kind:** Reviewer Pass
**Component/Task Group:** `pass_01_mount_volume_state_cleanup_02`
**Parent Meso-Component:** `meso_01_mount_volume_state`
**Covered Micro-Features:**
- `Boot region validation and parameter load at mount`
- `Allocation bitmap is the free-space truth source`
- `VolumeDirty marks in-flight versus quiesced global state`
- `VolumeFlags also carries media-failure and clear-before-modify state`
- `Up-case Table is the durable case-folding truth source`
- `Mount option defaults and remount mutability boundary`
- `Superblock counters and statfs reflect cached cluster accounting`
- `Asterinas mount lifecycle must eagerly expose root inode and global sync state`
- `Mount-time accounting may fall back to recount under corruption-recovery conditions`

## 2. Output Requirement
*The exact template the Subagent MUST fill out. Do not deviate from its structure.*
- **Required Template:** `kernel/src/fs/fs_impls/exfat_refactor/.agents/protocol/templates/pass_[XX]_[component]_reviewer_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Output Destination:** `kernel/src/fs/fs_impls/exfat_refactor/.agents/components/meso_01_mount_volume_state/pass_01_mount_volume_state_cleanup_02_reviewer.md`

## 3. Specific Overrides & Commands (Keep Minimal)
*Only list execution-specific overrides (like testing filters) or repair paths. NO architectural summaries, design hints, or "how-to" tutorials here.*
- Review this as the structural quality gate for `pass_01_mount_volume_state_cleanup_02` only; do not reopen unfinished later `meso_01_mount_volume_state` work.
- Confirm that the production `ondisk.rs` compatibility boundary is fully retired from the production owner path.
- In this review, do **not** limit yourself to newly introduced entities only. Perform a full production entity audit across the assigned write-set and explicitly inspect surviving production `struct`s, `enum`s, modules, and non-trait helper functions even if they predate `cleanup_02`.
- Treat clusters of naked production free helper functions as an explicit review target. If a helper family now sits loosely under an owner module without a convincing Rule A/B/C-style need or without a clear owner-type boundary, record that as structural debt and reject back to Creator.
- The goal is not to redesign every deferred `*Record` / `*State` carrier in this wave, but Reviewer must not silently pass exposed production helper families merely because they were already present before `cleanup_02`.
- Keep direct Reviewer edits line-level and non-functional only. Structural findings must reject back to Creator rather than be rewritten in Reviewer.
- Do not run build or test commands.
