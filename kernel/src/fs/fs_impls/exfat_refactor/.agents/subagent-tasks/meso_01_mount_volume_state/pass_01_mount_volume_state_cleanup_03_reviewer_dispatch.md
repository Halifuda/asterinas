# Subagent Dispatch Stub (Strict Funnel)

**Role ID:** REVIEWER
**Pass Kind:** Reviewer Pass
**Component/Task Group:** `pass_01_mount_volume_state_cleanup_03`
**Parent Meso-Component:** `meso_01_mount_volume_state`
**Covered Micro-Features:**
- `Boot region validation and parameter load at mount`
- `Allocation bitmap is the free-space truth source`
- `VolumeDirty marks in-flight versus quiesced global state`
- `VolumeFlags also carries media-failure and clear-before-modify state`
- `Up-case Table is the durable case-folding truth source`
- `Mount option defaults and remount mutability boundary`
- `Superblock counters and statfs reflect cached cluster accounting`
- `Asterinas mount lifecycle must eagerly expose root inode and global sync state`
- `Mount-time accounting may fall back to recount under corruption-recovery conditions`

## 1. Input Context (Read-Only)
*List exact file paths allowed by the Information Funnel for this Role. DO NOT summarize the contents. The Subagent MUST read these files directly.*

## 2. Output Requirement
*The exact template the Subagent MUST fill out. Do not deviate from its structure.*
- **Required Template:** `kernel/src/fs/fs_impls/exfat_refactor/.agents/protocol/templates/pass_[XX]_[component]_reviewer_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Output Destination:** `kernel/src/fs/fs_impls/exfat_refactor/.agents/components/meso_01_mount_volume_state/pass_01_mount_volume_state_cleanup_03_reviewer.md`

## 3. Specific Overrides & Commands (Keep Minimal)
*Only list execution-specific overrides (like testing filters) or repair paths. NO architectural summaries, design hints, or "how-to" tutorials here.*
- Review this as the structural quality gate for `pass_01_mount_volume_state_cleanup_03` only; do not reopen unfinished later `meso_01_mount_volume_state` work.
- The primary review target is the user-requested helper-family cleanup: confirm that the surviving production free-helper families in `boot.rs`, `fat.rs`, `bitmap.rs`, and `upcase.rs` were actually absorbed or otherwise narrowed under clear owner-local impl boundaries.
- Treat the `cleanup_03` Creator report's surviving-helper audit as a claim to verify, not as ground truth.
- The compile-fix fallout previously reported by `pass_01_mount_volume_state_cleanup_02_checker.md` was intentionally folded into this pass. Confirm those local fixes are structurally safe and did not reopen catch-all or helper-placement debt.
- Production helper review is the priority. Test-only diagnostics may remain helper-heavy if they stay under `#[cfg(ktest)]` boundaries and do not leak back into production ownership flow.
- Keep direct Reviewer edits line-level and non-functional only. Structural findings must reject back to Creator rather than be rewritten in Reviewer.
- Do not run build or test commands.
