# Main-Agent Pass Slicing Ledger

This file is the durable main-agent-owned record of how meso-level Architect / Designer contracts are split into pass-level Creator, Checker, and Reviewer work.

`SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` remains the active status board. This ledger records the scheduling decision, covered-micro boundary, and rationale so later main agents do not rediscover or accidentally widen previous pass slices.

## Rules

- Only the main agent updates this file.
- Record a decision before or at the same time a Creator, Checker, or Reviewer packet is dispatched.
- Keep Designer artifacts meso-scoped; do not ask Designers to pre-slice implementation passes.
- Every Creator-synced Checker pass mirrors its Creator pass exactly.
- Keep meso integration passes separate from Creator-synced Checker passes.
- When a structural cleanup pass exists, list each cleanup objective separately and record whether it is fully closed or intentionally deferred.

## Current Pass Slicing Decisions

- **`pass_00_old_ovfs_baseline_test`**
  - **Kind**: Pre-design legacy baseline Checker pass using the authorized overlay xfstests lane.
  - **Parent**: `legacy_overlayfs_baseline_validation` (temporary validation parent; not an accepted Architect meso-component).
  - **Covered micro-features**: `P0-01`, `P0-02`, `P0-03`, `P0-04`, `P0-05`, `P0-08`, `P0-09`, `P0-10`, `P0-11`, `P0-12`, `P0-14`, `P0-15`, `P0-18`, `P1-02`, `P1-03`, `P1-04`, `P1-06`, `P1-07`, `P1-08`, `P1-10`, `P1-12`, `P1-13`, `P1-16`, `P1-18`, `P1-21`, `P1-22`, `P1-23`, `P1-24`, `P1-25`, `P1-26`, `P1-27`, `P1-28`, `P1-29`, `P1-30`, `P1-31`, `P1-32`, `P1-34`, `P2-01`, `P2-02`, `P2-06`, `P2-07`, `P2-11`, `P2-12`, `P2-13`, `P2-14`, `P3-01`, `P3-02`, `P3-03`, `P3-04`, `P3-05`, `P3-08`, `P3-09`.
  - **Test scope**: every case listed by `test/initramfs/src/conformance/xfstests/overlay/run_list/full.list`; `overlay/100` and `overlay/101` remain case-matrix targets without a staged micro-feature mapping.
  - **Rationale**: establish a case-by-case legacy behavior matrix before the Architect converts the staged priors into the authoritative refactor topology. This pass has no Creator-synchronized companion and does not accept implementation work.
  - **Execution boundary**: one fresh QEMU and freshly recreated TEST/SCRATCH image pair per case; terminate at 300 seconds as `HANG/TIMEOUT`; classify exclusively from that case's `qemu.log` (`PASS`, `FAIL`, or explicit xfstests `[not run]` as `NOTRUN`); do not use `CORRUPT`; append the result before starting another case.
  - **Artifact boundary**: keep one reusable temporary single-case runlist only, keep one compact case-status table, and delete the temporary runlist after the baseline. Do not retain per-case logs or full per-case commands.

**Deferred / Exit Notes:**

- The baseline Checker report now preserves execution evidence for all target cases. The Architect wave is eligible for separate scheduling, but was not dispatched automatically by this baseline task.
